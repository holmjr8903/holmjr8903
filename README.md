- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @holmjr8903
- I am an old guy learning new stuff. I am a retired electrical engineer,
- with a fairly broad knowledge of signal processing, data analysis, 
- radar and communication systems, and statistics. I learned FORTRAN 40+ 
- years ago on a punch card system, but for most of my professional career,
- I used MATLAB for developing analysis and displaying report results.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in converting my analysis tools into a modern, 
- object-oriented framework. Python and its packages (NumPy, Matplotlib,
- pandas, ...) will be much of my focus area, with GitHub for version 
- control.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning beginner-level Python through JetBrains
- Academy. My current challenge is getting used to the object-oriented
- concepts and learning to discipline myself to follow the style guides.
- I also am somewhat overwhelmed by learning the PyCharm IDE and debugger.
- 
- ðŸ“« I can be reached at holmjr8903@gmail.com.
