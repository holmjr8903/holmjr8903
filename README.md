I am a retired electrical engineer with a fairly broad knowledge 
of signal processing, data analysis, radar and communication systems,
and statistics. I learned FORTRAN 40+ years ago on a punch card system,
but for most of my professional career, I used MATLAB 
for developing analysis tools and displaying report results.

I’m interested in converting my analysis tools into a modern, 
object-oriented framework. Python and its packages (NumPy, Matplotlib,
pandas, ...) will be much of my focus area, with GitHub for version 
control.

I’m currently learning beginner-level Python through JetBrains
Academy. I find it challenging to get used to the object-oriented
concepts and learning to discipline myself to follow the style guides.
I also am somewhat overwhelmed by learning the PyCharm IDE and debugger.
